# Getting Started with Tabular Foundation Models with TabPFN
### Presentation: [{ YOUR PRESENTATION NAME }](workshop/presentation_template.pdf)

## Workshop description
During this workshop, you'll get an intro into the new era of tabular foundation models (TFMs), how they differ from traditional ML models, as well as the new capabilities they unlock for AI agents. We will start with a light intro into TFMs, how they operate and what their capabilities are. Following this, we will do some hands on exercises with TabPFN for regression, classification and interpretability, as well as some more advanced tasks like time-series predictions.

## Requirements
* PyLadies Amsterdam uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management
* Google account if you want to use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
 
## Usage
### with uv
Run the following code:
```bash
git clone <github-url-of-workshop-repo>
cd <name-of-repo>

# create and activate venv, install dependencies
uv sync
```
### with Google Colab
1. Visit [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. In the top left corner select "File" &#8594; "Open Notebook"
3. Under "GitHub", enter the URL of the repo of this workshop
4. Select one of the notebooks within the repo.
5. At the top of the notebook, add a Code cell and run the following code:
```bash
!git clone <github-url-of-workshop-repo>
%cd <name-of-repo>
!pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### for a workshop giver
To get started, open the `pyproject.toml` file and set the required Python version. The pre-selected version 3.8 is generally a safe choice for most use cases.

After you have specified the Python version, you can create a virtual environment with `uv venv` and add packages with `uv add <package>`. Before the workshop, you can generate a requirements.txt file, which is needed e.g. for running code in Google Colab, by running `uv export > requirements.txt`.

## Appendix
### Pre-Commit Hooks

To ensure our code looks beautiful, PyLadies uses pre-commit hooks. You can enable them by running `pre-commit install`. You may have to install `pre-commit` first, using `uv sync`, `uv pip install pre-commit` or `pip install pre-commit`.

Happy Coding :)
